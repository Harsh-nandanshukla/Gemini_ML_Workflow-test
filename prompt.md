## Context

You are a data scientist working on a **fraud detection** problem.  
You are given a transactional dataset and asked to build a **simple, end-to-end machine learning pipeline** that cleans the data, performs basic feature engineering, trains a model, evaluates it, and saves key artifacts to disk.

The objective is not to build a complex or highly optimized model, but to carefully follow instructions and generate **reproducible outputs** that can be validated using automated unit tests.

Do not ask for clarification at any stage.
